# COVID-19-Publication-Dashboard
Dashboard for weekly COVID-19 publication

Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak Public Health Scotland (PHS) has been working closely with Scottish Government and health and care colleagues in supporting the surveillance and monitoring of COVID-19 amongst the population.

Each week, a statistical report covering COVID-19 in Scotland is published. This report can be found [here](https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/population-health/covid-19/covid-19-statistical-report/).

This GitHub repository contains the R project for the accompanying [interactive shiny dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/nhs-covid19-weekly/).
